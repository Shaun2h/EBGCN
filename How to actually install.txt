The installation process is identical to bigcn. For convenience, this is copied here.



You probably want to venv this because it toggles with versions of scikitlearn and other things.
guys, cuda ISNT always back compatible. 


To install torch (assuming you go with 1.7 instead of their 1.4 due to GPU compatibility), use:
pip install torch==1.7.0+cu110 torchvision==0.8.1+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

Do NOT use torchvision==0.8.0+cu110 the file does NOT exist as a "stable" version in their link.

https://data.pyg.org/whl/ 
    - Select your appropriate pytorch version link here, which then directs you to available BUILT wheels for cluster, sparse, scatter.
    Ignore spline.
    
    python -m pip install <wheel name>
    
    
torch_geometric can be installed via 
    python -m pip install torch-geometric==2.0.0 
    
    DO NOT USE 1.3.2 as they CLAIMED. IT WONT RUN IF YOU DO THAT

This is the approximation.

Run:
python -m pip install transformers==4.17.0 



unzip their datafile, create other folders they need.

run:

unzip -d ./data/Weibo ./data/Weibo/weibotree.txt.zip

# If required:
mkdir .\data\Twitter15graph
mkdir .\data\Twitter16graph
mkdir .\data\weibograph


In the home directory  (AND IT MUST BE THE HOME DIRECTORY)
python ./Process/getWeibograph.py
python ./Process/getTwittergraph.py Twitter15
python ./Process/getTwittergraph.py Twitter16
python ./model/Twitter/BiGC N_Twitter.py Twitter15 100


In ./model/Twitter/BiGC N_Twitter.py and ./model/Weibo/BiGCN_Weibo.py

Set num_workers to 0 for compatibility issues. This is due to their classes being UNPICKLEABLE.

You also want to run Pheme_Tree_extraction.py, which can actually extract the entire pheme trees and stuff from
all-rnr-annotated
which is the pheme dataset. just leave all-rnr-annotated in the current folder with this. (without taking out the events)

More customisation can be done to TRACE back the original words that were used...



For pheme....
python main_ebgcn.py --datasetname PHEMEevents 1> PHEME_training_output.txt 2>&1
python main_ebgcn.py --datasetname PHEMEsplits 1> PHEME_training_output.txt 2>&1

for original
python main_ebgcn.py
